## Player Mark Customization

The traditional tic tac toe player marks ```X``` and ```O``` which are drawn on the tic tac toe's board can be customized to any single letter. As an example, one player can use a ```Z``` mark and the other one a ```W``` mark. 

**Traditional marks (X, O):**

```
  X |  O |  O
====+====+====
  O |  X |  X
====+====+==== 
  X |  O |  X 
```

**Customized marks (Z, W):**

```
  Z |  W |  W
====+====+====
  W |  Z |  Z
====+====+==== 
  Z |  W |  Z 
```


## Board Size Selection

Tired of easy and quick matches on a 3x3 board? Just select a board with 4 or 5 rows for more brain-intensive matches! The actual limit is a 5x5 board! Actually, bigger boards will be executed properly but are just too long and boring! Hence, I've set a maximum of 5 rows and cols (and a minimum of a 3x3 board, of course).

**3 x 3 board:**
```
  0 |  1 |  2
====+====+====
  3 |  4 |  5
====+====+==== 
  6 |  7 |  8 
```

**4 x 4 board:**
```
  0 |  1 |  2 |  3
====+====+====+====
  4 |  5 |  6 |  7
====+====+====+==== 
  8 |  9 | 10 | 11
====+====+====+====
 12 | 13 | 14 | 15
```

**5 x 5 board:**
```
  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4
====+====+====+====+====
  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9
====+====+====+====+====
 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14
====+====+====+====+====
 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19
====+====+====+====+====
 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24
 ```
