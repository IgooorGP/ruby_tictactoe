# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module contains functions that are used to configure the game
# when its being started. The following properties are configured by
# the player's input:
#
# difficulty: newbie, medium or hard
#
# game_type:  player vs computer, player vs player, computer vs computer
# 
# p1_mark/p2_mark : sets a single char (string) to be the player mark
# (e.g., "X", "O", etc.)
#
# n: the number of rows/cols of the board
#
# board: builds a string array to be used as the board of the game
